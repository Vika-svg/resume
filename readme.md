## Summary

I’m a project manager with IT experience, passionate about leading projects from concept to completion. An integral part, therefore, is to maintain a close relationship with the cross-functional teams to better understand their requirements and to set common achievable goals. I am constantly trying to improve my skillset and broader knowledge in the area of IT in order for me to effectively communicate with developers and various stakeholders. I find the process to be rewarding, and it has become a newfound passion of mine.

## Summary

I’m an experienced and proactive software developer passionate about front-end development but with strong and proven skills in back-end development as well. I am driven by curiosity, problem solving, and a desire to create engaging products and user experiences. I care a great deal about application architecture, API design and build tooling. I have a strong sense of ownership of the projects I take on and I really enjoy seeing projects through from beginning to end. I thrive in collaborative working environments where people combine their different strengths, challenge each other’s way of thinking and work towards a common goal.
